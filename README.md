This is result of my work with TMDB api:  
All of these scripts requires Python 3.x.  
Each program could work separate, but 3rd and 4th need DataBase from the second task to work.  
Also there is full Eng interface.  


***
# 1. Hello_api_TMDB #
#### This is the first task, 
I made function for searching film budget by it's number in TMDB.  
You need to enter your api_key_v3, wich you could get [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/).  
Then program print budget of film â„–215 in TMDB.  
#### example of code process:
  ***Enter your api key v3***

# 2. My_own_DB #
#### Second task,
I made program to download info about 1000 films from TMDB.  
You could find this info in file MyFilmBD.json after run.  
It also requires api_key_v3.  
#### example of code process:  
  ***Enter your api key v3***  
  *64be4144d51bbaee6234f2w82bb*  
  **(here would be percents of code process)**  
  ***Process finished with exit code 0***  
  > Remember, that you must delete this in couple of days, because TMDB don't allow to save their data
